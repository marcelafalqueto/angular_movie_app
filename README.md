# angular_movie_app
This is an angular movie app done in the training period at my first job. It was done as a training exercise and during the formation period at the first IT job I had.

This is a movie app project done with Angular, CSS and HTML.

The main characteristics are that it can collect data from the MovieDB API and show some posters representing the movies.

You can also check info about an specific movie, add to favorites and search by a word.

Although it is a simple project, I had the chance to practice coding with one of the most popular frameworks on the market in today's time.

With this project, I could learn how to code with a focus on components.

I could also learn about two-way data binding, event binding, property binding, pipes, dependency injection, directives, services, and routing.




If you want to download the repository and it is your first time running an Angular app, I will leave here some instructions for you:

1 - download and unzip the directory.

2 - inside your terminal, go to the directory where you unzipped the directory.

3 - for this step you need nodejs installed. Run "npm install" (without " ") and press enter.
(this will install the dependencies needed to run the app. If you are new to this, this directory alone is too big to upload here, so we always do without it)

4 - for this step you need Angular CLI installed - run 'ng s --o' (without ' ') and press enter. This step will start a server locally and will automatically open the browser with the app.
(to keep testing the app you can not close the terminal, if you do the app will stop running. If you close the browser and want to open again the app, with the terminal opened you just need to open again the browser and type 'localhost:4200' (without ' ') and press enter.
